# CPlusPlus-Treasure-Hunt
A turn-based C++ Treasure Hunt console game with scoring, hidden board logic, random placement, and player vs. computer mode.
##  How to Play
1. Run the program in a C++ compiler or IDE (g++, VS Code, etc.)
2. The board begins hidden
3. On each turn:
   - Player enters a row and column
   - The computer randomly chooses a valid coordinate
4. Board updates and score changes are shown live
5. Game ends when treasure is found or all cells are revealed
##  Future Improvements
- Difficulty levels (larger boards, more traps)
- Multiple treasures
- Timer or limited number of turns
- GUI or web version
